#1st Oct
Sent a lot of call to action messages for follow up and got a lot of replies
A lot of people replied saying that they would rather prefer answering questions on chat or don't have the time to book a call.
Will have to try shorter duration calls
#2nd Oct
Got referrals from people as they were busy and said don't have time to do an informational call after 3rd follow up along with the ask.
Some people are too busy so they said that they don't have time to join informational calls.
Will make some changes in making an ask by asking them to introduce me to people I might want to talk.
#3rd Oct
Got some responses from people after 3rd follow up message.
Updated availability on weekends as well on calendly as few people are not available on weekdays
Will have to find people more closely relevant to my domain areas in automotive and GIS
#4th Oct
A lot of people who replied preferred talking over phone or just asking questions over chat.
Received some connections through people who have introduced me to them
Will talk to those people over phone
#6th Oct
People who have similar background in GIS are showing interest and responding as well
Few people responded after 3rd follow up after making the 3rd ask
Need to understand why referrals are not converting to first round interview calls.
#7th Oct
Had a short informational call with a data engineer who works at CVS health.
Got a referral from Deloitte after reaching out to someone on LinkedIn and asking for informational call.
Both online application and referral to first interview needs to be improved.
