    "    - use `i % 2 != 0`\n",
    "- to create an empty dict `dict_name = {}`\n",
    "- you cannot subtract two lists\n",
    "- `bool(\"fsdf\")` - I thought it would convert it to a bool but it check if the str exists such as not `None` or empty\n",
    "    - I thought it woudl change `bool(\"False\")` => to `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always test your method/function before you test it in the app.\n",
    "- range - does not run the stop interation, you must do +1\n",
    "- **Diving into the problem before using an example on paper or on your get**\n",
    "- You have to use `sorted()` not `sort()` for string \n",
    "    - when you `sorted()` it sored by char (case sensitive)\n",
    "    - `sorted()` has a param of `key=` that takes a str function (e.g. `lower()`, `casefold()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Tricks\n",
    "- `range` does not include the last number so if you want it to have no range you can use the same number `range(2,2)` \n",
    "- for dict you can use `dict_name[key]`\n",
    "- you can add two lists\n",
    "- `Counter` from `collection` lib is very helpful for a hashable dict function to count freq\n",
    "- variable inline if statements\n",
    "    - `var = <value> if <statement> else <value>`\n",
    "    - Trick if you want  it to be `False` you can do `var = var1 != var2 if var1 else True`\n",
